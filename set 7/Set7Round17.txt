In the Meselson-Stahl experiment, the mechanism for DNA replication was investigated using Escherichia coli [e-schuh-ri-KEE-uh koh-LY] as a model. E. 
coli was grown in medium with heavy nitrogen until all the DNA was labeled with the heavy 
isotope. Then, the E. coli was transferred to fresh medium with lighter nitrogen and the bacteria 
replicated once. The DNA was extracted from the bacteria using a density gradient to separate 
light-nitrogen DNA, heavy-nitrogen DNA, and light/heavy mixed DNA to decide whether 
replication was conservative or semiconservative. Which of the following results was predicted if 
replication was conservative?
